# Repository Name: CSE 210-Projects

## CSE 210 Python Projects

This repository contains my coursework, assignments, and projects for the CSE 210 course, where we delve into the principles of programming with classes using C#. Throughout this course, we will explore the concepts of classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in the context of software development.

### Course Overview

CSE 210 introduces the fundamental concepts of programming with classes. We will learn how to design software using class-based principles, enabling us to create flexible, maintainable, and cost-effective software solutions. The primary programming language used in this course is C#, and you are not expected to have prior experience with C#. Instead, we will build upon your understanding of programming principles gained in CSE 111: Programming with Functions.

1. **sandbox**: An empty project where you can experiment and practice various programming concepts related to the course. Use this space to explore new ideas and build your coding skills.

2. **csharp-prep**: Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments. These projects provide a starting point for completing the C# Prep work required before starting the main assignments.

3. **prepare**: Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities. These projects will help you prepare for the weekly assignments and provide a starting point for your code.

4. **prove**: Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects. These projects serve as the foundation for the weekly programming assignments that you need to complete and submit.

5. **final**: Starter projects for the final project. This is where you'll start building your final project based on the concepts and skills learned throughout the course.

## Getting Started
