## CSE 210 C# Projects

Welcome to the CSE 210 C# Projects repository! This is where the coursework, assignments, and projects for the CSE 210 course are showcased. In this course, the principles of programming with classes using C# are explored, including concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, all in the context of software development.

### Course Overview

CSE 210 introduces the fundamental concepts of programming with classes. The course covers how to design software using class-based principles, enabling the creation of flexible, maintainable, and cost-effective software solutions. The primary programming language used in this course is C#, and no prior experience with C# is expected. Instead, students are encouraged to build upon their understanding of programming principles gained in CSE 111: Programming with Functions.

### Folders Description

1. **sandbox**: An empty project where students can experiment and practice various programming concepts related to the course. This space allows for exploring new ideas and building coding skills.

2. **csharp-prep**: Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments. These projects provide a starting point for completing the C# Prep work required before starting the main assignments.

3. **prepare**: Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities. These projects help students prepare for the weekly assignments and provide a starting point for their code.

4. **prove**: Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects. These projects serve as the foundation for the weekly programming assignments that students need to complete and submit.

5. **final**: Starter projects for the final project. This is where students start building their final project based on the concepts and skills learned throughout the course.
