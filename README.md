## CSE 210 Python Projects

Welcome to the CSE 210 Python Projects Repository! This repository contains my coursework, assignments, and projects for the CSE 210 course, where we delve into the principles of programming with classes using C#. Throughout this course, we will explore the concepts of classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in the context of software development.

### Course Overview

CSE 210 introduces the fundamental concepts of programming with classes. We will learn how to design software using class-based principles, enabling us to create flexible, maintainable, and cost-effective software solutions. The primary programming language used in this course is C#, and you are not expected to have prior experience with C#. Instead, we will build upon your understanding of programming principles gained in CSE 111: Programming with Functions.
